    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everyone is excited these days about the <a href="https://500ish.com/the-9-bullet-points-of-doom-for-espn-a692d0f48182">death of ESPN</a>, particularly as evidence of the <a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/12/Long-Slow-Death-Cable-Just-Reached-Tipping-Point">death of &ldquo;bundle priced&rdquo; Cable TV</a>. Consumers are supposed to be excited that soon they will only have to pay for the content they want. Don&rsquo;t get too excited yet.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s remember the basic purpose of bundled cable TV: for content producers, cable company bundles provide an easy, single outlet for their content. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;somebody else&rdquo; who will get the content to their viewers, sell advertising, and collect payment. For consumers, bundles provide a packaged set of channels that&rsquo;s easier to manage (and price) than a bunch of individual contracts.</p>

<p>Apart from whatever level of collusion exists in the TV world, the prices for bundles have reached some sort of equilibrium: basic cable TV with Internet costs about US$45, and &ldquo;channel bundles&rdquo; are $30-40 on top of that. Seems like a great savings for cord cutters, AND they only have to get the content they want, right?</p>

<p>Maybe not. A cord cutter still pays $35/mo for basic Internet. They pay $9/mo for an annual Netflix subscription, but not everything is available on Netflix. The TV and Movie industry use their copyright stranglehold to limit a lot of high demand content to Hulu, for $8/mo. And since the cord-cutter demographic is also the prime demo for Game of Thrones, there&rsquo;s HBO Now for $15/mo. Turns out that if you want to get access to the same content you got in your cable bundle, you&rsquo;re looking at $67/mo, or $71/mo if you include Amazon Prime. And what happens when ESPN opens their live streaming channel?</p>

<p>What happened to our cord-cutter savings? Suddenly it looks like you&rsquo;re paying the same amount of money, just to different people &ndash; plus, you&rsquo;re stuck with the administrative pain of keeping track of what shows are available on which service, and making sure you&rsquo;re subscribed. Of course, the number of services is still growing, so this part of the cost is only going up.</p>

<p>I have a great business idea: I&rsquo;ll handle all the subscriptions for you, and you just pay me one monthly fee. $90 per month, and you can have Internet access with Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and Amazon all together. You get the simplicity of knowing you&rsquo;re subscribed to all the most popular services, without having to track every one or handle the payments. I call it &ldquo;bundling&rdquo;. See what I did there?</p>

<p>There is a market niche for bundled services in any multi-channel environment. It sure seems like cable is dead, and bundle pricing with it. But the truth is it&rsquo;s just in transition. We&rsquo;ll still pay basically the same amount, for the same things we did before; we just get a new delivery mechanism.</p>
