After <a href="http://swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com/2010/12/unlocking-and-jailbreaking-my-iphone.html">wasting my evening</a> working out a jailbreak/unlock for an old version of IOS, I discovered a side note in a <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/1718400992/ultra-recycle">devteam blog update</a>&nbsp;that gave me clues on how to jailbreak and unlock my phones for the latest version of IOS. &nbsp;So I spent another evening working on that. <br /><br />I haven't seen complete instructions anywhere yet, so here they are. &nbsp;How to update your iPhone 3GS to 4.2.1, jailbreak, and unlock it for multiple carriers. &nbsp;(for Mac)<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>Download the IOS 4.2.1 firmware, either over P2P or using iTunes. &nbsp;To download using iTunes, accept it's prompt to get the latest firmware, but "download only." &nbsp;This firmware file will be called&nbsp;iPhone2,1_4.2.1_8C148a_Restore.ipsw , and you can find it using your computer's find utility. &nbsp;On a Mac, it will be in ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates &nbsp;(~ is shorthand for your home folder. Click the blue happy face in the bar on the bottom of your screen if you are confused).</li><li>Download and install the latest version of <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/1359246784/20102010-event">Pwnagetool</a>&nbsp;(4.1 as of this writing) from the <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/1718400992/ultra-recycle">devteam blog</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li><li>Pwnagetool does not yet have a framework for working with the 4.2.1 firmware. &nbsp;To add that framework, first download it from <a href="http://iphwn.org/advanced/iPhone2,1_4.2.1_8C148a.bundle.zip">iphwn.org</a>. &nbsp; Extract this file to get a .bundle , which is what pwnagetool needs to work with this IOS version.&nbsp;</li><li>Right click on your pwnagetool "app" in OSX and choose "Show Package Contents." &nbsp;Look in Contents &gt; Resources &gt; FirmwareBundles . &nbsp;See all those .bundle files, named for each version of IOS? &nbsp;That's where you should put the 4.2.1 .bundle you just downloaded.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ukp9db12h9g/TQ6txreow-I/AAAAAAAAAAM/EEqzeqHYQ2k/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-12-20+at+2.13.13+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="264" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Ukp9db12h9g/TQ6txreow-I/AAAAAAAAAAM/EEqzeqHYQ2k/s320/Screen+shot+2010-12-20+at+2.13.13+AM.png" width="320" /></a></div></li><li>Now start up Pwnagetool, select "expert" mode, and browse for your vanilla 4.2.1 firmware that you downloaded from iTunes. &nbsp;Before compiling your custom firmware, hit the button for "General" options, and uncheck the box for "activate." &nbsp;Sorry, activation has to be done in a separate step. &nbsp;Now go ahead and build that custom firmware!</li><li>Follow Pwnagetool's instructions to get your iphone into DFU mode, and then use iTunes to restore to your custom firmware. &nbsp;If you haven't done this before, you have to Option+click the "restore" button, then browse to the new custom firmware, which should be named something like iPhone2,1_4.2.1_8C148a_Custom_Restore.ipsw . <br /><br />Some of you may ask, but if we aren't activating via Pwnagetool, then what's the difference? &nbsp;The custom firmware only includes the 4.2.1 SYSTEM. &nbsp;It doesn't include the new, hack-proof baseband. &nbsp;The baseband is the part of your phone that actually communicates with the cellular network. &nbsp;Think of it like your modem firmware, it's pretty close.&nbsp;</li><li>Now you have to activate your phone! &nbsp;Download and install the latest version of <a href="http://wikee.iphwn.org/howto:rs9#download_links">Redsn0w</a>. &nbsp;I found the devteam link was broken, so I got it from <a href="http://www.iphoneworld.ca/news/2010/12/04/download-redsn0w-0-9-6b6-iphone-jailbreak-now-with-sam-support-windows-mac/">here</a>.</li><li>Run Redsn0w. &nbsp;When it asks you for your firmware ipsw, browse to the VANILLA version of 4.2.1 that you got through iTunes. &nbsp;Make sure you check the box for "Install Cydia" when prompted, and follow the instructions closely! &nbsp;This will activate your phone. &nbsp;Now all we have to do is unlock!</li><li>On your iphone, connect to a wireless network and start the Cydia application. &nbsp;Go to the "Manage" tab along the bottom, and tap the big "Sources" button. &nbsp;Add a new source, at URL http://repo666.ultrasn0w.com . &nbsp;Now go to the search tab, and search for ultrasn0w. &nbsp;Install it, and restart your iphone.</li></ol><div>Voila! &nbsp;One bona fide, jailbroken, unlocked, activated iphone 3GS on 4.2.1! &nbsp;Now, don't come crying to me when your battery starts running down.</div>

<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
While I was away over the weekend, I borked my iphone. &nbsp;I was running IOS 4.0, and I was having trouble with network connections.<br /><ul><li>The statusbar wouldn't reflect my actual connection status. &nbsp;WiFi connections would rarely show up in the statusbar, though I knew I was surfing wirelessly (my router at 10.10.10.1 was accessible to the phone, for starters...)</li><li>WiFi would periodically crash. &nbsp;In the middle of a good network connection, it would just. stop. working. &nbsp;I could go to System Preferences and see that WiFi was inexplicably disabled. &nbsp;If I tried to enable it, the switch animation would work, but no networks would be visible. &nbsp;Exiting and re-entering System Preferences would show WiFi disabled again.</li><li>Periodically all networking would crap out. &nbsp;The statusbar would show a good 3G connection, and ifconfig would show an IP... but the phone couldn't establish any connections, anywhere. &nbsp;</li></ul><div>Only rebooting ever solved any of the above problems. &nbsp;So this weekend I started to look into it, and it occurred to me that maybe SBSettings was interfering with networking - I periodically disable or enable Wifi in SBSettings, and it occurred to me that maybe there was a conflict there. &nbsp;So I uninstalled SBSettings, (noting that it unnecessarily included iphone zsrelay in the uninstall)...</div><div><br /></div><div>And my phone stopped getting signal. &nbsp;I had never seen anything like it before. &nbsp;It didn't show an operator, just 0 signal bars. &nbsp;It could get wifi, but couldn't access the Internet over it. &nbsp;In retrospect, I think the SBSettings uninstall borked my yellowsn0w unlock, and at the same time my networking subsystem in general wasn't working. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The solution was clear - I had to reinstall. &nbsp;I figured I would do an update at the same time, just in case the networking issue was related. &nbsp;So I spent this evening painfully updating to 4.1.2. &nbsp;For anyone who encounters the same kind of pain I did:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Don't bother with the latest Apple firmware. &nbsp;Firmware 4.2.1 is not easily crackable for the iphone 3gs yet, and besides, <a href="http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=12944">the most common way</a> to crack is to install the baseband from the iPad (06.15), which brings&nbsp;all sorts of problems, including broken GPS and disappearing battery charge.... deal breakers for most people IMO. &nbsp;</li><li>But when you try to install a non-current version of the firmware, iTunes won't let you! &nbsp;It phones home to the iTunes update servers to make sure that you are restoring to the most recent version. &nbsp;If it hears back that there is a MORE RECENT version than what you are trying to use, it will throw a message:</li></ul><blockquote><i>This device is not eligible for the requested build</i></blockquote><ul><li>If you use the older hack, and change your /etc/hosts so that gs.apple.com points to 127.0.0.1 (your own computer), it will complain that the update server is not responding, and refuse to go forward. &nbsp;This check involves an exchange of an encrypted key, which uses your unique iPhone's ID as one variable and Apple's passphrase as another. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.saurik.com/id/12">Saurik (of Cydia fame) set up a server</a>&nbsp;(note: really awesome post, recommended reading) to keep a backup of examples of successful SHSH key "handshakes" for each device, so you have to use the IP of this server instead.<br /></li></ul><br /></div>So here are the steps I had to follow, for reference:<br /><br /><ol><li>Download the 4.1.2 .ipsw for your iphone. &nbsp;I found it on binsearch by searching iPhone2,1_4.1_8B117_Restore.ipsw .</li><li>Download PwnageTool - get it from the torrent or the links on the official <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/">devteam blog</a> site only! Everyone else is at best a scammer, or at worst a hack stealing the product of devteam's hard work.</li><li>Use <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/1359246784/20102010-event">pwnagetool</a> to build yourself a custom version of the 4.1.2 firmware you just downloaded.</li><li>To foil Apple's update server check, add a line to etc/hosts pointing gs.apple.com to&nbsp;74.208.10.249 , Saurik's SHSH backup IP as of this writing. <br />If you have used Cydia before (and clicked the "make my life easier" button), this will be enough to get the restore going. &nbsp;If not, even a failed check of your validity for the firmware involves a key exchange, and having this IP in /etc/hosts will make sure that the SHSH key gets uploaded to Saurik's server. &nbsp;Give it about a day, and try again. &nbsp;Did I remember to link to Saurik's<a href="http://www.saurik.com/id/12"> really interesting blog post</a> about this? It explains a lot. &nbsp;If that doesn't help, try the <a href="http://thefirmwareumbrella.blogspot.com/">TinyUmbrella tool</a>.</li><li>When your custom .ipsw is written, put your iphone into DFU mode, open iTunes, and OPTION-click (for Macs) on the Restore link to select your custom firmware.</li><li>When your phone is restored and working, use Cydia to install ultrasn0w (the unlock).</li></ol>This took up MUCH to much of my evening. &nbsp;Once again, I found myself exercising creativity in swearing at computers.
