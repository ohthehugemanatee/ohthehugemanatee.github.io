I know no one reads this blog but me, but I may as well put this up here. &nbsp;Net Neutrality: I'm for it.<br /><br />Steve Wozniak has an excellent <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/an-open-letter-to-the-fcc-regarding-net-neutrality/68294/">Open Letter</a> up on the Atlantic about the issue. &nbsp;He takes the examples of public goods such as roadworks and compares them favorably to privately managed utilities like Cable TV and Internet. <br /><br />Personally, I think his letter is a much more effective critique of the FCC than it is a championing of the public works model of construction. &nbsp;After all, it's the FCC that regulates the cable and telephone industries so ineffectively. &nbsp;And the very road system he proclaims as being so effective was a famous example of political favor outweighing practicality when the road system was devised in the 19th Century. <br /><br />In this case though, I think we have a free and open marketplace of ideas by explicit design in the Internet. &nbsp;It is trivially simple to create rules to preserve this. We should.
