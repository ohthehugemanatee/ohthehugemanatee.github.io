I’ve been lax about posting lately, and to make this easier on myself I think I’ll post a bunch of quick guides for basic coding procedures with Drupal. Simple things and concepts, explored in just enough detail for you to understand how it works, resource links so you can actually go and put it into practice. <br><br>The first thing you need to understand about Drupal is the structure. Drupal is a modular Content Management System, built on PHP and whatever-database-you-want-which-is-probably-mysql-lets-face-it. Drupal &lt;=6.x actually requires MySQL or PostGres, and they&#8217;re still the standard on 99% of installs you&#8217;ll face.  The thing is, Drupal is incredibly flexible and capable. And the trick to coding with Drupal is to code WITH Drupal, not against it. There are tons of helper functions built in that make your life easier, if only you&#8217;ll work the way Drupal expects you to work. So this first post is about how Drupal expects you to work.  Drupal itself is a complicated guy that lives in several php files and directories. You are expected to NEVER touch any of these files or directories yourself. Seriously. 16,000 coders can&#8217;t be wrong, just leave it the fuck alone. You have access to OVERRIDE anything and everything that Drupal does though, and you can do that from a nice contained subdirectory where you can keep an eye on your code. This is the /sites subdirectory.  See, one Drupal codebase can actually host many websites. Each one gets its own subdirectory under /sites. for example, I might have:  /sites/swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com /sites/subdomain.swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com /sites/swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com.subdirectory  The directory name tells Drupal what incoming requests should be forwarded to which site. You can see how subdomains and subdirectories are handled in the naming convention, too. Pretty easy stuff. There&#8217;s also a special subdirectory for &#8220;default&#8221;, and one for &#8220;all&#8221;. Not to complicated to figure out: &#8220;all&#8221; is for code that applies to all your sites, and &#8220;default&#8221; is the sites subdirectory for when other names don&#8217;t match.  I&#8217;ll tell you a pro secret: hardly any of the big shops ever actually use the multi-site capability. In practice it&#8217;s a pain in the ass to remember which sites use which version of which module, and Drupal itself doesn&#8217;t take up any significant space. So most of us just set up a separate Dru&#8230;</div></div>

Ouch, Sony.

<br>It’s a popular saying that “dogs can smell fear.”  There are similar stories about sharks with blood - actually, even chickens respond to blood with a pecking frenzy of their own.  Anecdotally we all know people who react the same way.  Maybe it’s something in our animal nature, but this is definitely a similar issue.  <br><br>People love to jump on the big guy when he’s down.  After the first big attack on Sony, hackers around the world had their interest piqued.  It was a pretty big security lapse, after all!  Then we found &#8230;</div></div>

Varnish is a fantastic caching proxy, commonly used for CMSes.  It’s not uncommon to see benchmarks boasting 300-500 page loads per second - I’ve seen benches up to 5000 hits per second.  That’s faster than serving flat HTML from Apache; we’re talking about a serious benefit to your server load here.<br><br>Part of Varnish’s tremendous speed comes from how lean it is.  At only 58,000 lines of code, it’s very lightweight.  Unfortunately, this necessitates a no-frills approach.  And SSL is a frill.  <br><br>I think it’s very well put by Poul Henning-Kamp (lead developer on the Varnish project) in this <a href="http://www.varnish-cache.org/lists/pipermail/varnish-misc/2010-April/004044.html">mailing list post</a>:<br><br><blockquote>I have two main reservations about SSL in Varnish:<br><br>1.

I wouldn’t want to be a Sony sysadmin right now. <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002160.html">F-Secure just blogged</a> about evidence of a <strong>fourth</strong> hack at the electronics giant.   This one is relatively harmless - a phishing scam being run from Sony servers - but this pattern of security problems should tell us a few things about Sony’s SysAdmin staff:<br><br>1) They’re powerless in their own organization.<br>2) They don’t get to set IT resource policy.<br>3) They’re furious at their bosses right now.<br><br>It’s hard to generalize like this across an entire organization, but I’m willing to bet that in the affected departments this is the case.  Let’s look at what we know about the hacks.  <br><br>The first two involved stealing millions of users’ credit card information, which was stored unencrypted and vulnerable during a DoS.  The hackers got in with a list of valid usernames and a dictionary attack.  I don’t know any SysAdmin, no matter how junior, who would leave 100 million users’ financial and personal information in an unencrypted format.  And on a server with access to this unencrypted financial information, who doesn’t impose password standards?  I can understand a vulnerability during an exceptional circumstance - a really good SysAdmin team has contingency plans for this sort of thing, but at least it’s an understandable problem - but dammit, that&#8230;</div></div>

Lately I’ve been getting hit by an odd kernel bug on one of the servers I maintain.  It’s discussed in some depth on <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/+bug/614853">Launchpad</a>, but the gist is that when trying to find an idle cpu for a new thread, the scheduler divides by cpu_power.  On EC2 instances, it’s possible for cpu_power to be 0, which causes a divide by zero kernel crash.  <u>Why</u> cpu_power is 0 is still an unknown; this should never be the case.  But in the meantime, there’s a patch committed to ec2 kernel 2.6.32-313.26 which adds a check before running this division.  If cpu_power is 0, it waits a bit and tries again.  I believe it also adds a kernel yell, to help with tracking down the underlying problem.  In the meantime, this bug was crashing one of my instances.<br><br>So it’s time to update the kernel.  This should be easy, right?  apt-get dist-upgrade seems to do it… but if you reboot, uname -r will tell you you&#8230;</div></div>

<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is <a href="http://campbell.vertesi.com/">Campbell Vertesi</a>, and I&rsquo;m an <a href="http://thecastmusic.com/">opera singer</a> and a web developer. I&rsquo;ve been a <a href="https://drupal.org">Drupal</a>ist for 11 years, and I presently work as a Drupal Architect for <a href="https://amazeelabs.com" title="Amazee Labs">Amazee Labs</a>, where I get to work on some of the most cutting edge projects with brilliant people.

<p>This is a technical blog that&rsquo;s partly a reference for myself, partly a pointer for all the instructions I end up writing for others, and partly a document of my technical history. I&rsquo;m someone who is involved in a lot of different fields and specialties, and it&rsquo;s nice to have it all catalogued somewhere. I&rsquo;ve written this blog on various platforms under different names (swearingatcomputers, mostly), but this is where I&rsquo;m hoping it will stay for awhile.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not responsible for any damage caused to yourself, your family, your friends, your pets, or anything else as the result of using this information. Be smart and be careful.</p>
