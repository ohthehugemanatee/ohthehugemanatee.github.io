  <div class="entry-content"><h2><strong>What and Why?</strong></h2>


<p>Everyone loves the <strong>git flow</strong> method for managing branches in development projects. If you’ve been living under a rock and don’t know what git flow is, here’s <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">the original blog post that brought order to branching chaos</a>. Honestly you can get a really good idea just by looking at the diagram:</p>


<p><br><img alt="" src="/downloads/drupal/git-flow.png" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px; float: left;" height="484" width="363"></p>


<p>Git-flow is a great branching methodology. It leverages git’s merge strength to the max, and lets you focus on the important things. The only problem is: it requires a lot of development environments.</p>


<p>This isn’t actually a problem for many projects. Most coding projects keep their important work - you guessed it - in code, and a new development environment is just a “git checkout -b branchname” away. But for Drupal projects it can be a real pain. Setting up a new environment means copying codebase, files, and db… not particularly hard to do, but enough effort that most people take short cuts. For this reason, most firms don’t rea&#8230;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems like any time anyone has to configure a server for SSL/TLS, they treat it like some kind of voodoo magic. And I guess it can seem that way: if you get your certificates in the right formats from your certificate authority, you basically just drop them into Apache/NGINX/whatever and let it go. </p>


<p>But what happens if those files <strong>aren’t</strong> in the right format by default? And what if you actually want to understand what’s going on with your server?</p>


<p>The truth is, encryption is not terribly difficult to understand. It’s a little tricky to explain, and the maths in the nitty gritty of it can get really intense, but a high level understanding is important for anyone who works with SSL. </p>

<p>What’s fantastic about Rules is that it lets everyone who wants your module to behave slightly differently to <em>change the behavior for themselves</em>. In fact, if you build the logic of your module into Rules you get an excuse to reject half the tickets in your contrib module queue on the grounds of “works as intended,” aka “do it yourself.”  To me, this is the quiet brilliance of Commerce module’s dependence &#8230;</p></div>

I recently took over an aging Drupal module, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/resource_conflict">Resource Conflict</a>. It had a D6 version with a lot of outstanding bugs in the queue… I started by simply <a href="http://drupal.org/node/976522">rewriting it for D7 and my specific use case</a>, but ended up in a discussion with the module’s old maintainer about a total rewrite for <a href="http://drupal.org/project/entity">Entities</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a>. So <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1575800">that’s what I did</a>, and I just released the <a href="http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/resource_conflict-7.x-3.x-dev.tar.gz">7.x-3.x-dev</a> version.<br><br><a href="http://drupal.org/project/resource_conflict">Resource Conflict</a> USED to be a module that detected booking conflicts in resources, and threw a form error.

This lets it support a wide variety of use cases.<br><br><b>How to use it</b><br>Out of the box, the module lets you enable Content Types for resource conflict checking, and you select which date field to use for each enabled content type. &#8230;</div></div>

Drupal is big and complex, and no matter how good you are, you will need to debug.

Ah, it’s nice to be done with the basic structure stuff. At this point, I’m going to assume that you know the basics of how to administer a Drupal site. You understand the <a href="http://swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com/2012/04/drupal-quick-learning-guides-drupal.html">file structure</a>, you know where to go to download <a href="http://drupal.org/project/themes">themes</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/modules">modules</a>, and you know how to make sites out of the big pieces you can find that way. Awesome. This is where it gets fun.  I’m going to assume some basic knowledge of PHP, but there’s nothing here that you can’t pick up with some quick glances over at <a href="http://w3schools.com/php/">w3schools</a>, and maybe some experimentation on your own.<br><br>I mentioned in the file structure post that the whole point of Drupal is that Everything Is Override-able. If you want to customize the site beyond what you get out of the box with some contributed modules, you’re going to want to do it in your own module. That’s right - it’s incredibly easy to write your own Drupal module to insert whatever code you want into your particular Drupal site. In fact, it’s the recommended way to customize your site, because it means that your code won’t get mixed up with anything in Drupal’s “core”. If you update Drupal, you don’t have to worry about refa&#8230;</div></div>

I’ve been lax about posting lately, and to make this easier on myself I think I’ll post a bunch of quick guides for basic coding procedures with Drupal. Simple things and concepts, explored in just enough detail for you to understand how it works, resource links so you can actually go and put it into practice. <br><br>The first thing you need to understand about Drupal is the structure. Drupal is a modular Content Management System, built on PHP and whatever-database-you-want-which-is-probably-mysql-lets-face-it. Drupal &lt;=6.x actually requires MySQL or PostGres, and they&#8217;re still the standard on 99% of installs you&#8217;ll face.  The thing is, Drupal is incredibly flexible and capable. And the trick to coding with Drupal is to code WITH Drupal, not against it. There are tons of helper functions built in that make your life easier, if only you&#8217;ll work the way Drupal expects you to work. So this first post is about how Drupal expects you to work.  Drupal itself is a complicated guy that lives in several php files and directories. You are expected to NEVER touch any of these files or directories yourself. Seriously. 16,000 coders can&#8217;t be wrong, just leave it the fuck alone. You have access to OVERRIDE anything and everything that Drupal does though, and you can do that from a nice contained subdirectory where you can keep an eye on your code. This is the /sites subdirectory.  See, one Drupal codebase can actually host many websites. Each one gets its own subdirectory under /sites. for example, I might have:  /sites/swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com /sites/subdomain.swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com /sites/swearingatcomputers.blogspot.com.subdirectory  The directory name tells Drupal what incoming requests should be forwarded to which site. You can see how subdomains and subdirectories are handled in the naming convention, too. Pretty easy stuff. There&#8217;s also a special subdirectory for &#8220;default&#8221;, and one for &#8220;all&#8221;. Not to complicated to figure out: &#8220;all&#8221; is for code that applies to all your sites, and &#8220;default&#8221; is the sites subdirectory for when other names don&#8217;t match.  I&#8217;ll tell you a pro secret: hardly any of the big shops ever actually use the multi-site capability. In practice it&#8217;s a pain in the ass to remember which sites use which version of which module, and Drupal itself doesn&#8217;t take up any significant space. So most of us just set up a separate Dru&#8230;</div></div>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working with computers for 21 years, with PHP and Drupal for 13 of those. I started with desktop repair, moved into sysadmin work, and eventually discovered web development. Since then I&#8217;ve been in most roles in the web consultant ecosystem: coder, themer, project manager, information architect, technical lead, CEO, and CTO. I&#8217;ve presented at many conferences, including almost 20 Drupalcons. <a href="/about-me.html" title="More about me">More about me</a>.</p>

<p>This is a technical blog that&#8217;s partly a reference for myself, partly a pointer for all the instructions I end up writing for others, and partly a document of my technical history. I&#8217;m involved in a lot of different fields and specialties, and it&#8217;s nice to have it all catalogued somewhere. I&#8217;ve written this blog on various platforms under different names, but this is where I&#8217;m hoping it will stay for awhile.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not responsible for any damage caused to yourself, your family, your friends, your pets, or anything else as the result of using the information on this blog. Be smart and be careful.</p>
