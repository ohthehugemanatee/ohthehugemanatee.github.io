Now a quickie - one of my favorite tools: awk.  Some of you will probably think of this as obvious, and that’s great.  But tools like awk are the things that I skipped learning when I got started… and when I finally started using them, my world expanded tremendously.  Here’s hoping I can pay it forward to one other sysadmin out there.  So let’s get going.<br><br><b>Awk</b><br><b><br></b><br>My first handy command is <i>awk</i> . This command lets you set a pattern to hunt for, and then an action to take every time it finds the pattern.  Pattern, action.  And that’s the format on the command line:<br><blockquote>awk pattern {action}</blockquote>If you omit the patter&#8230;</div></div>

About a month ago, I picked up my first Android phone: the HTC Inspire 4g, from AT&amp;T in the US.  I determined to root it, install a custom OS, and laugh at all the poor saps who get bad battery life on HTC Sense.<br><br>The first challenge is in the name.  See, the HTC Inspire 4G is really just a rebranded HTC Desire HD, which is a tweaked HTC Desire, which is another name for the HTC Ace. <br><br>I eventually got my head on straight, with the help of the good people at the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1018">xda-developers forum</a>, and in particular with the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=952352">Ace Hack Kit</a> which is linked there.  Windows types might be interested in <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=961406">Bubby’s Simple Root and S-Off</a> kit, which is apparently wonderful and easy to use.  I wouldn’t know, my PC is all the way on the other side of the room.   I did this on my Mac, which is right in front of me.<br><br>In a nutshell, here’s what you&#8230;</div></div>

The damnedest thing happened - I went out of town.  I went out of town, and discovered that I was STILL getting dropouts every 90 seconds!  On a totally different router, on the opposite site of the planet, in a rural area with no conceivable wireless interference.  This prompted me to boot into Windows 7 (I have a Boot Camp partition) to try my ping test under a totally different software stack.<br><br>Even under Windows, every 90 seconds I would get a ping spike for a second. <br><br>This means it’s got to be hardware, or &#8230;</div></div>

I run an XBMC mediacenter at home, on my old Compaq C765 laptop (the laptop I used to use as a Hackintosh, until I got a real Mac).  I say it’s old, but it’s perfectly well powered:<br><br><ul>
<li>2.1ghz Intel Core 2 Duo</li>
<li>2gb RAM</li>
<li>Intel GMA X3100 “graphics” adapter</li>
</ul>
<div>Apart from the X3100, it’s a perfectly good little computer, and perfect for a media center.  XBMC is super easy to install - just install Ubuntu as you normally would, and install the XBMC package using your favorite package manager (“apt-get install xbmc” will do it).</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>What’s great about XBMC is that all the configuration is through the TV graphical interface.  No pain in the ass backend to configure (I’m looking at YOU MythTV), it just works.  I like that.  </div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The real pain in the ass though, came when I wanted to play HD movies.  The whole point of having a mediacenter is to keep all your movies and TV shows on a hard drive, so I ripped a couple of my favorite Planet Earth episodes in HD, and gave it a shot.  Unfortunately, Ubuntu’s built in HD video decoder (libavcodec/ffdshow/ffmpeg) requires too much power for my little mediacenter.  I couldn’t get through the intr&#8230;</div>

I have had all sorts of trouble with the wireless situation in my apartment.  The layout of the place is such that the kitchen sits in between the two major rooms (living room and bedroom), and I swear those kitchen walls must be made of lead.  No wireless signal seems to get through.  I have phone jacks for ADSL in the living room and bedroom, nothing in between.<div><br></div>
