<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is one of the greatest <strong>orchestration</strong> and <strong>scaling</strong> tools ever built, designed for modern <strong>decoupled</strong>, <strong>stateless</strong> architectures. Kubernetes tutorials abound to show you these strong use cases. <strong>But in the real world where you don’t get to build “green field” every time, there are a lot of applications that don’t fit that model</strong>.</p>

<p>Lots of people out there are still writing tightly-coupled monoliths, in many cases for good reason. In some use cases microservices style scalability isn’t even useful – you actually <em>prefer</em> stateful applications with tight coupling.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I wrote a Drupal module that uses face recognition to automatically tag images with the people in them. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/ohthehugemanatee/image_auto_tag">Github</a>, of course. With this module, you can add an image to a node, and automatically populate an entity_reference field with the names of the people in the image. This isn’t such a big deal for individual nodes of course; it’s really interesting for bulk use cases, like Digital Asset Management systems.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/image-auto-tag.gif" title="Automatic tags, now in a Gif."></p>

<p>I had a great time at Drupalcon Nashville, reconnecting with friends, mentors, and colleagues as always. But this time I had some fresh perspective. After 3 months working with Microsoft’s (badass) CSE unit – building cutting edge proofs-of-concept for some of their biggest customers – the contrast was powerful. The Drupal core development team are famously obsessive about code quality and about optimizing the experience for de&#8230;</p></div>

So far, so good!</p>

<p>But every time I’ve asked for support, or visited IT, or encountered something that didn’t work perfectly, I hear the same question: “Why do you want to run open source software, anyway?”  The question isn’t asked with malice or condescention. It’s asked with genuine curiosity. This is tremendous progress for Microsoft.</p>

<p>Ubuntu has a built in DNS cache, which it checks first when trying to resolve anything. This Makes Sense For The User in that DNS queries are resolved faster if they come from local cache.

<p>First I have to acknowledge the history. I co-founded my first tech company just as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents">Halloween documents</a> were leaked. That’s where the world learned that Microsoft considered Open Source (and Linux in particular) a threat, and was intentionally spreading FUD as a strategic counter.

The Microsoft approach to Open Source only got more aggressive from there, funneling money to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO/Linux_controversies">SCO’s lawsuits</a> against Linux and its users, calling OSS licensing a “cancer”, and accusing Linux of violating MS &#8230;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot is made of so-called “rockstar developers” in any given language or framework. They have a seemingly magical knowledge of the language and API, finding obscure methods and writing best-practice code as if by instinct. I’d like to lift the curtain on this: it’s not that hard to be this kind of rock star. You can do it, too… even without a fancy computer science degree. If you know how to code in a given language, you just need 3 skills and some patience. It will take about a year of working this way to get there, but you’ll find people throwing around “the R word” sooner than you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve learned something incredible as the PHP Track Chair for Drupalcon Vienna. <strong>The Drupal Association has no way to invite PHP speakers to Drupalcon</strong>.</p>

<p>This blew me away when I first learned about it. After all the work to bring mainstream PHP to Drupal core, after all the outreach to <a href="https://php-fig.org">PHP-FIG</a>, after all the talks Drupalists have given at major PHP conferences, how is this possible?</p>

<p>You see, <strong>basically every other PHP conference covers their speakers’ travel and accommodation costs</strong>. Drupalcon doesn’t, and never has. Historically it has to do with Drupalcon’s identity as a community conference, rather than a professional one. But it means <strong>the best PHP speakers never get to Drupalcon</strong>.</p>

<p>On one hand that’s great for our project: our speakers are all passionate volunteers! They’re specialists who care deeply about the project. On the other hand, it contributes to isolated, “stay on the island” thinking. If the only speakers we hear are Drupalists, where do we get new insights? If the only people at the BoF or code sprint table&#8230;</p></div>

<p>I tried starting into Startup Manager by holding the “Option” key. No bootable options appeared. Just an unhopeful file folder with a question mark. This was Not A Good Sign.</p>
